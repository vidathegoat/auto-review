    "\n",
    "### 🧠 IDE\n",
    "- **[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)** (VS Code)\n",
    "  A lightweight, powerful editor that supports Jupyter notebooks out of the box.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧩 Required Extensions\n",
    "- **Jupyter** extension (published by Microsoft)\n",
    "  - Go to Extensions `(Ctrl+Shift+X)` → Search for `Jupyter` → Install.\n",
    "- (Optional) **Python** extension (also by Microsoft) for syntax highlighting and Python support.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧪 Python Environment\n",
    "- Python version **3.9+** recommended.\n",
    "- Use `venv`, `conda`, or your preferred environment manager to isolate dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔁 Kernel Instructions\n",
    "Once you open the notebook:\n",
    "1. Click the top-right **kernel selector** (it may say “Python 3” or “Select Kernel”).\n",
    "2. Choose the environment where you've installed your requirements.\n",
    "3. If no environment appears, make sure it’s activated and Python is installed."

    "\n",
    "This project is designed as a Jupyter Notebook, which runs Python code in cells. Here's how to interact with it:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧾 Opening the Notebook\n",
    "1. Launch **VS Code**.\n",
    "2. Open the folder containing this project.\n",
    "3. Open the `.ipynb` file (`auto_manual_review.ipynb` or similar).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🚀 Running Cells\n",
    "- **Click** on a cell to select it.\n",
    "- **Run a cell** by pressing:\n",
    "  - `Shift + Enter` — runs the cell and moves to the next.\n",
    "  - `Ctrl + Enter` — runs the cell but keeps the focus on it.\n",
    "  - You can also use the **▶️ Run** button in the top bar.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📌 Important Notes\n",
    "- **Run cells in order.** The notebook is designed to be executed from top to bottom.\n",
    "- **Don't skip setup cells**, especially those that handle imports, functions, and cookie authentication.\n",
    "- Output will appear directly below each cell when run."
